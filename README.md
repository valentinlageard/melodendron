# Melodendron

> This is a non-stable prototype.

A musical composition generator capable of learning and recreating specific styles.
Melodendron is capable of real-time learning and generation as well as midi file based learning and generation.
Under the hood, Melodendron uses multiple viewpoints variable order markov models.
Basically: a recreation of Francois Pachet's Continuator.

Features :
- Learns and generates midi based on a given style.
- Does not need a huge dataset to train.
- Real time co-improvisation capability.
- Midi file based learning and generation.

## TODO

- [ ] Real time midi to state parsing.
- [ ] Real time interactive Q&A.
- [ ] Real time generator.
- [ ] Non real time generator.
